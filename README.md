If they register after login, they are redirected to the confirmation page, where they can click directly on the link to authenticate themselves and then access the home page, where the user, depending on their role (Admin or Assistant), can choose to go directly to the dedicated dashboard and from there access the various features, 
and to log out, return to the home page and log out of the application.
